# Text To Speech 

This project was created for the course MYY803 -- Software Engineering (undergraduate course at the University of Ioannina department of Computer Science and Engineering) 

## Getting Started

This is a simple GUI where you can create some documents and transform them to speech. There are several other choices of interaction such as transform the text or a single line in reverse, encode the text and replaying all the previous commands etc.

### Installing

In this Project we used the library FreeTTS.
FreeTTS is an open source speech synthesis system written entirely in the Java programming language.
Everything is set up and ready to play.

### How to use 

You need to open the project file with IntelliJ or Eclipse and run it.
The GUI of the application will pop up. Then you can create a new Document by providing a name and a title. Now you can add a text and click the Edit Text button (Edit / Edit Text) or use the combination on your keyboard CTRL + S. In this point you can explore the functionality of this app (transform text to speech/in reverse etc). To save/open your document to/from disk you need to click File->Save/open Document.
